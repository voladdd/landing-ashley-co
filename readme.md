### What I learned

In this project ive learned how to use some of HTML semantic elements such as form, sections, and it's approved for me usefullnes of this thing. Also ive added observer to detect whenever section get showed on user view and then play smooth fade animation. And the last cool feature was scrool snaping, that give me ability to snap user view to whole section.

### Continued development

In future project im planning to collobarate with designers to implement unusual sites layout, master my grid technique, and start learning about speed perfomance and adoption for end user.
